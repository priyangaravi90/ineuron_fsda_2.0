1.Explain DAX.

  1.DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions
  2.It is a formula language used in Microsoft Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services Tabular. 
  3.DAX is designed to perform calculations, define custom formulas, and create calculated columns and tables within these tools.
  4.DAX operates on tables of data. 
  5.It allows you to create powerful calculations and aggregations based on column values and relationships between tables.

Here  some key features and concepts related to DAX:

    Formulas: 
	  
	  - DAX formulas are used to create calculated columns, calculated tables, and measures. 
	  - These formulas are written using functions, operators, and constants to perform calculations and transformations on the data.

    Functions: 
	  
	  - DAX provides a wide range of built-in functions to perform various operations like mathematical calculations, text manipulation, date and time calculations, conditional logic, and more.
	  - Functions like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, IF, and CALCULATE are commonly used in DAX expressions.

    Calculated Columns: 
	  
	  - A calculated column is a column that you can add to a table, which derives its values based on a DAX formula. 
	  - These columns are calculated row by row and can be used for filtering, sorting, and creating relationships with other tables.

    Measures: 
	  - Measures are calculations that are applied to an entire table or a subset of the table's data. 
	  - They are typically used for aggregations like sums, averages, counts, and percentages. Measures are defined using DAX formulas and can be used in visualizations to provide summarized information.

    Relationships: 
	  - DAX leverages relationships established between tables to perform calculations and aggregations across multiple tables. 
	  - By defining relationships, you can create more complex calculations based on related data.

     Context: 
	  - DAX evaluates formulas in the context of rows and columns of tables. 
	  - It considers the current filter context and applies calculations accordingly. 
	  - Understanding how DAX handles context is crucial for writing effective formulas.

DAX is a powerful language for working with data and performing complex calculations in Power BI and other Microsoft tools. It allows you to create dynamic and interactive reports and dashboards by combining data from multiple tables and applying calculations to meet your analysis requirements.

 

2.Explain datasets, reports, and dashboards and how they relate to each other?

Datasets, reports, and dashboards are components of a data analysis and visualization platform like Microsoft Power BI.
 
   Datasets: 
     
	 1.Datasets are collections of data that are organized and structured for analysis. 
	 2.They typically consist of tables with rows and columns of data. 
	 3.Datasets can be created from various data sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or online services. In Power BI, you can import data into datasets or establish a connection to live data sources

   Reports: 
   
     1.Reports are interactive and visual representations of data derived from datasets. 
	 2.They allow users to explore and analyze data using different visualizations such as charts, tables, maps, and graphs. Reports provide a flexible and customizable way to present data insights. 
	 3.You can create reports in Power BI by selecting visualizations, dragging and dropping fields from the dataset onto the report canvas, and applying filters, slicers, and calculations.

   Dashboards:
     
	 1.Dashboards are a collection of visualizations, reports, and other elements that provide an overview of key metrics and data points in a consolidated view. 
	 2.Dashboards are often used to monitor the performance of a business or specific aspects of data.
	 3.They can include live data, and users can interact with them to drill down into details. 
	 4.Dashboards are typically designed to be shared and viewed by multiple users within an organization. 
     
	 datasets provide the underlying data, reports visualize and analyze that data, and dashboards consolidate and present the most important information from multiple reports and datasets.
	 Together, they form a comprehensive data analysis and visualization platform that enables users to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
