1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to
print the string "too low"if guess_me is less than 7, "too high" if greater than 7, and "just right" if equal
to 7.
.

here's the code with the conditional tests you described:

guess_me = 7

if guess_me < 7:
    print('too low')
elif guess_me > 7:
    print('too high')
else:
    print('just right')
In this code, the variable guess_me is assigned the value 7. Then, the if, elif (short for "else if"), and else statements are used to perform different actions based on the value of guess_me. If guess_me is less than 7, it prints 'too low'. If it's greater than 7, it prints 'too high'. If none of these conditions are met, i.e., if guess_me is equal to 7, it prints 'just right'.


2. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me and the value 1 to the variable start. Write a while
loop that compares start with guess_me. Print too low if start is less than guess me. If start equals
guess_me, print "found it!" and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print "oops" and exit
the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.

Here's the code that implements the while loop with the described conditions:
guess_me = 7
start = 1

while start <= guess_me:
    if start < guess_me:
        print('too low')
    elif start == guess_me:
        print('found it!')
        break
    else:
        print('oops')
        break
    start += 1

In this code, the while loop continues as long as the value of start is less than or equal to guess_me. Inside the loop, there are three possible conditions checked using the if, elif, and else statements:

If start is less than guess_me, it prints 'too low'.
If start is equal to guess_me, it prints 'found it!', then exits the loop using the break statement.
If start is greater than guess_me, it prints 'oops', then exits the loop using the break statement.
At the end of each iteration of the loop, the value of start is incremented by 1 using start += 1.



3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.

Here's how you can print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop in Python:
my_list = [3, 2, 1, 0]

for value in my_list:
    print(value)
In this code, the for loop iterates through each value in the my_list list, and in each iteration, it prints the current value. 

The loop will output:
3
2
1
0


4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in range(10)

Sure, here's how you can create a list of even numbers in the range from 0 to 9 (using range(10)) using a list comprehension in Python:
even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)

In this code, the list comprehension iterates through the numbers in the range 0 to 9 (exclusive) using the range(10) function. The condition x % 2 == 0 checks whether each number is even, and only the even numbers are included in the even_numbers list. 
The resulting list will be:
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]




5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares. Use range(10) to return the
keys, and use the square of each key as its value.

Here's how you can create a dictionary called squares using a dictionary comprehension in Python:
squares = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}
print(squares)

In this code, the dictionary comprehension iterates through the numbers in the range 0 to 9 (exclusive) using the range(10) function. For each number x, it creates a key-value pair in the squares dictionary, where the key is x and the value is the square of x calculated using x ** 2. 
The resulting dictionary will look like:
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}


6. Construct the set odd from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension (10).

Here's how you can create a set called odd containing the odd numbers in the range from 0 to 9 (using range(10)) using a set comprehension in Python:

odd = {x for x in range(10) if x % 2 != 0}
print(odd)

In this code, the set comprehension iterates through the numbers in the range 0 to 9 (exclusive) using the range(10) function. The condition x % 2 != 0 checks whether each number is odd, and only the odd numbers are included in the odd set.
The resulting set will be:
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}


7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string "Got " and a number for the numbers in
range(10). Iterate through this by using a for loop.

Here's how you can create a generator comprehension that produces strings like 'Got 0', 'Got 1', ..., 'Got 9' using a for loop to iterate through it:
generator = ('Got ' + str(x) for x in range(10))
for item in generator:
    print(item)

In this code, the generator comprehension creates a generator that yields strings formed by concatenating the string 'Got ' with the current number in the range from 0 to 9 (exclusive). The for loop then iterates through the generator and prints each item, resulting in the following output:
Got 0
Got 1
Got 2
Got 3
Got 4
Got 5
Got 6
Got 7
Got 8
Got 9




8. Define a function called good that returns the list ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"].

here's how you can define the function good that returns the list ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione'] in Python:
def good():
    return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']

# Call the function and print the returned list
result = good()
print(result)

In this code, the good function is defined without any parameters. It simply contains a return statement that returns the list ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']. When you call the good function and print the result, it will output:
['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']


9. Define a generator function called get_odds that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a
for loop to find and print the third value returned.

Here's how you can define a generator function called get_odds that yields the odd numbers from the range 0 to 9 (using range(10)) and then use a for loop to find and print the third value returned by the generator:
def get_odds():
    for num in range(10):
        if num % 2 != 0:
            yield num

# Create a generator object from the function
odds_generator = get_odds()

# Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned
for _ in range(3):  # Skip the first two values
    third_odd = next(odds_generator)

print(third_odd)
In this code, the get_odds generator function yields odd numbers from the range 0 to 9 using the condition num % 2 != 0. The generator object is created by calling the function. Then, a for loop is used to iterate through the generator, skipping the first two values. The third value returned by the generator is stored in the variable third_odd and printed.



10. Define an exception called OopsException. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write
the code to catch this exception and print "Caught an oops".

how you can define the OopsException exception, raise it, and then catch it using a try and except block to print the specified message:
# Define the custom exception
class OopsException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    # Raise the custom exception
    raise OopsException("Something went wrong!")

except OopsException as e:
    print('Caught an oops:', e)

In this code:
The OopsException is defined as a custom exception class that inherits from the base Exception class.
Inside the try block, the raise statement is used to raise the OopsException with a custom error message.
The except block catches the raised OopsException and prints the message 'Caught an oops' along with the exception message.

When you run this code, it will output:
Caught an oops: Something went wrong!




11. Use zip() to make a dictionary called movies that pairs these lists: titles = ["Creature of Habit",
"Crewel Fate"] and plots = ["A nun turns into a monster", A haunted yarn shop&#39;]

You can use the zip() function to combine two lists into a dictionary. Here's how you can create a dictionary called movies by pairing the titles and plots lists:
titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']
plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']

movies = dict(zip(titles, plots))
print(movies)

In this code, the zip() function combines the titles and plots lists element-wise, creating pairs of title and plot. The dict() function then converts these pairs into a dictionary. The resulting movies dictionary will look like:
{'Creature of Habit': 'A nun turns into a monster', 'Crewel Fate': 'A haunted yarn shop'
