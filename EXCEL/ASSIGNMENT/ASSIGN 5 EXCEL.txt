1. How many types of conditions are available in conditional formatting on Excel?

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Microsoft Excel offers various types of conditions that you can use for conditional formatting. These conditions allow you to format cells based on specific criteria. The exact options and terminology might have changed in newer versions of Excel, but as of my last update, some common types of conditions available in conditional formatting include:

   Cell Value: 
      Format cells based on their numerical or text values, such as greater than, less than, equal to, between, etc.

   Formula:  
      Use custom formulas to determine the formatting criteria based on cell values or other conditions.

   Top/Bottom Rules: 
      Format the top or bottom "N" values or percentages in a range of cells.

   Data Bars: 
       Apply gradient-filled bars to cells based on their values.

   Color Scales: 
       Apply color gradients to cells based on the relative values in the selected range.

   Icon Sets: 
       Display icons (such as arrows, flags, etc.) based on the cell values.

   Text Contains: 
       Format cells based on specific text within them.

   Duplicate Values: 
       Identify and format duplicate or unique values.

   Blank Cells: 
       Format cells that are empty or non-empty.

   Date Occurring: 
       Format cells based on specific dates or time periods.

   Expression: 
      Use custom expressions to define formatting conditions.

  Stop If True: Allows you to create multiple rules and stop applying further rules if a condition is met.

Please note that the availability of these conditions and their exact names might vary based on the version of Microsoft Excel you are using. It's recommended to refer to the official documentation or your Excel's help resources for the most up-to-date information.

6. How do you use text commands in Excel?

In Microsoft Excel, you can use text commands in various ways to perform actions, calculations, and manipulations on your data. Text commands are typically entered into cells, formulas, or specific Excel functions. Here are a few common ways to use text commands in Excel:

  Formulas and Functions: Many Excel functions and formulas involve using text commands to manipulate text data. For example:

  CONCATENATE Function: You can use this function to combine multiple text strings into a single string.
                        LEFT, RIGHT, MID Functions: These functions extract portions of text from a larger string based on specified positions or lengths.
  
  LEN Function: This function calculates the length of a text string.
   
  FIND and SEARCH Functions: These functions help you locate a specific substring within a larger text string.

  SUBSTITUTE Function: Use this function to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a text string.
  
  TEXT Function: You can use this function to format numbers as text using custom formats.

  Data Cleaning and Formatting: Text commands are useful for cleaning and formatting text data:

  Text to Columns Wizard: You can split text in a single cell into multiple cells using delimiters.
                          PROPER, UPPER, LOWER Functions: These functions help you change the case of text within cells.
  Custom Lists and AutoFill: You can create custom lists of text values and use AutoFill to quickly fill cells with these values.

  Comments and Notes: You can add comments to cells to provide additional information using text.

  Naming Ranges: You can assign names to ranges of cells using text to make referencing and formulas easier.

  Data Validation: Use text commands to set up custom data validation rules for text input in cells.

  Text Manipulation in VBA: If you're using Excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), you can write custom macros and scripts that involve extensive text manipulation.
