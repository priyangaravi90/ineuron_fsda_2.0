100101    Rohan                 72     55     52     69     95     32

2. From the above table use Sum Formula and find the total for each
student.

To calculate the total for each student using a SUM formula, you can follow these steps:

Assuming your table is located in cells A1 to G11 (with the headers in the first row and data starting from the second row), you can enter the following formula in cell H2 to calculate the total for the first student (Rohan):

=SUM(C2:G2)

Then, drag this formula down for all the other students (Mohan, Ravi, Ruby, etc.). The cell references will adjust automatically for each student, and you will get the total for each student in the corresponding row in column H.

For example, the formula in cell H3 will be:=SUM(C3:G3)

You can continue this pattern for the rest of the students. This will give you the total marks for each student across subjects.



3. Calculate Average for each student in the next row. Use Formulas.

To calculate the average for each student using a formula, follow these steps:

Assuming your table is located in cells A1 to G11 (with the headers in the first row and data starting from the second row), you can enter the following formula in cell H12 to calculate the average for the first student (Rohan):
=AVERAGE(C2:G2)
Then, drag this formula across for all the other students (Mohan, Ravi, Ruby, etc.). The cell references will adjust automatically for each student, and you will get the average for each student in the corresponding row in column H.

For example, the formula in cell H13 will be:
=AVERAGE(C3:G3)
You can continue this pattern for the rest of the students. This will give you the average marks for each student across subjects.


4. Calculate Rank for each student. Use Formulas.

To calculate the rank for each student using a formula, follow these steps:

Assuming your table is located in cells A1 to G11 (with the headers in the first row and data starting from the second row), you can enter the following formula in cell I2 to calculate the rank for the first student (Rohan):
=RANK(H2, $H$2:$H$11, 0)
Here, H2 refers to the total of the first student, and $H$2:$H$11 specifies the range of totals for all students. The 0 at the end of the formula specifies that you want the largest value to have the lowest rank.

Then, drag this formula down for all the other students (Mohan, Ravi, Ruby, etc.). The cell references will adjust automatically for each student, and you will get the rank for each student in the corresponding row in column I.

For example, the formula in cell I3 will be:
=RANK(H3, $H$2:$H$11, 0)

You can continue this pattern for the rest of the students. This will give you the rank for each student based on their total marks.


5. Calculate Percentage for each student. Use Formulas. Round off the
decimals up to 2 points.

To calculate the percentage for each student using a formula and rounding off the decimals to 2 points, follow these steps:

Assuming your table is located in cells A1 to G11 (with the headers in the first row and data starting from the second row), you can enter the following formula in cell J2 to calculate the percentage for the first student (Rohan):
=ROUND((H2 / (G2 * 100)) * 100, 2)

Here, H2 refers to the total marks of the first student, and G2 refers to the total marks possible for all subjects (assuming it's the same for all students). The formula calculates the percentage by dividing the total marks obtained by the total marks possible, and then multiplying by 100. The ROUND function is used to round off the result to 2 decimal places.

Then, drag this formula down for all the other students (Mohan, Ravi, Ruby, etc.). The cell references will adjust automatically for each student, and you will get the percentage for each student in the corresponding row in column J.

For example, the formula in cell J3 will be:
=ROUND((H3 / (G3 * 100)) * 100, 2)
You can continue this pattern for the rest of the students. This will give you the percentage for each student rounded off to 2 decimal places.
